## Why use TRANSPOSE data?

Data on open peer review (OPR), co-review, and detailed preprinting policies could be useful to many different stakeholder groups. Here are a few different examples:

|Group|Type|Use case|
|:----|:---|:-------|
|Researcher|OPR|As an early career researcher, I want to know which journals will give me credit for peer review so that I can demonstrate that Iâ€™m an expert in my field for my green card application|
|Funder|OPR|As a funder who wants to promote open science, I need a list of journals that comply with my policies on open peer review so that I can recommend them to grantees.|
|All|All|As an advocate, I want to know journal policies across fields so that I can monitor the adoption of certain policies over time.|
|Researcher|OPR|As a PI, I want to quickly and anonymously check policies on co-reviewing so that I can involve my student in peer review and make sure I'm compliant and giving students credit.|
|Publisher|OPR|As a journal editor or publishing staff, I want to review and evaluate my journal's peer review policies against others so that I can best serve my research community.|
|Researcher|OPR|As a meta-researcher, I want to pull journal peer review policies so that I can study the history, trends, and effectiveness of different peer review implementations over time.|
|Funder|OPR|As funder, I want to know the journals that publish reviewer names and their reviews so that my grantees can get credit for peer review.|
|Institution|Co-review|As the director of a graduate program, I want a list of journals open to co-reviewing so that I can facilitate peer review training.|
|Researcher|OPR|As a graduate student wanting to learn to peer review, I want a list of journals that publish peer review so I can read good and bad examples.|
|Researcher|OPR|As a PI, I want to know which journals will give me credit for doing peer review so that I can build a stronger tenure and promotion package.|
|Researcher|OPR|As an author, I want to pick journals that publish peer review so that I can receive more constructive feedback on the research.|
|Researcher|OPR|As an author, I want a list of journals that do "open interaction" collaborative peer review so that the requested revisions are more clear.|
|Researcher|OPR|As an early career researcher concerned about bias, I want to choose a journal that publishes peer reviews so that this risk would be minimized through transparency.|
|Funder|OPR|As a funder, I want to read the peer review of the papers I fund so that I can ensure the results are not shared in a journal that has predatory publishing practices.|
|Journalist|Preprints|As a journalist, I want authors to know the policy of journals they've submitted to regarding media coverage of preprints so that I can write about preprints without causing a paper to be rejected.|
|Researcher|Preprints|As an author, I want to quickly check the list of preprint servers approved across journals so that I do not waste time submitting to a journal where my preprint posting would go against a journal's restrictive prior publication policy.|
|Publisher|Preprints|As a preprint server, I want to be know preprint policies across journals so that I can be a reliable resource to recommend to researchers what journals to submit.|
|Institution|Preprints|As an institutional administrator trying to promote open science, I want to know the journals which allow preprints so that I can include them in a list for my researchers.|
|Institution|All|As a librarian, I want an easy way to look up journal policies across publishers and fields so that I can better advise researchers.|
|Technology & service provider|Preprints|As the developer of a reference manager, I want to know which journals allow citations to preprints so that I can code citation styles appropriately, or notify users when they try to add a disallowed citation.|
|Technology & service provider|OPR|As the representative of a manuscript tracking system, I want to learn journal peer review policies so that I can better serve the peer review needs of my clients.|
